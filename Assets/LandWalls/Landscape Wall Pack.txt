Landscape Wall Pack

Introductory price, get them while they are cheap!

Big pack (currently 33) of terrain meshes usefull for example for:

Filling the space between your actual map and the skybox. You get nice 3d alternative to the 2d paralax effect.

Making low poly low resource terrain map limited by rocky "walls"

Adding terrain features to your existing terrain.

Heaps of other uses :-)

The "Walls" come in several styles, sizes and types (valley / hill)

The meshes are low poly. Their performance cost is minimal.

All meshes are split into 10 parts so you can use only part of them or even use the individual block to bild your own shapes

Vegetation and rocks are separate meshes. They can be disabled if it suits your project.

Enjoy,
